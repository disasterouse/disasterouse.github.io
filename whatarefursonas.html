<h1>"What is a fursona?", you might ask yourself.</h1>
<p style="color: white;width:675px">A fursona is the representation of a furry. Simply put, it's like an alter ego, or a persona of someone. Fursonas are usually seen online, in art, or in the real world, be it whilst wearing a full fursuit, a partial suit, or just as a tail that you can buy, or just as someone calling themselves by their fursona name. I could go more in depth ito this, but it would take to long.</p>

    Anyway, here's a documentary on furries made by National Geographic, to try and help you understand furries better down below.</p>
