<h1>Some furry webcomics, if you're interested.</h1>
<p style="color:white;"> Below are two links to two sites that can lead you to furry webcomics.</p>
<a href="http://katbox.net/">
    <img src="katbox.png" alt="An old icon for Katbox, a website full of furry webcomics."
    width="25%">
</a>

<a href="http://twokinds.keenspot.com/comic/1/">
<img src="pawlogo.png" alt="A logo for a webcomic called twokinds">
</a>
<p style="color: white; width:  675px;">I cannot guarantee that any of them are school apropiate, since it's been a while since I've visited any of them. Proceed with caution.</p>
<p style="color: white; width:  675px;"> Note: the Twokinds one will lead you to the first page of the comic, just so you're not confused or lost in the story.</p>
<p style="color: white; width:  675px;">I did not make any of the logos, nor did I help make them, nor do I take credit for them.</p>
